/**
 * Migration 021 — create_mfa_enrollments_table
 *
 * Stores per-user TOTP MFA enrollments with the TOTP secret encrypted at rest.
 *
 * Design decisions:
 *  - `user_id` is a TEXT primary key (NOT a FK to users(id)) because
 *    authenticated identities in this service come from JWT claims or the
 *    `x-chronopay-user-id` header, and not every identity is guaranteed to
 *    have a row in `users`. Enrolment is still gated server-side by the auth
 *    middleware, and rows are deleted by the GDPR erasure path.
 *  - Cipher fields split into dedicated columns (ciphertext / iv / auth tag /
 *    KDF salt) so the row is fully self-describing: a fresh decrypt needs no
 *    external metadata, and the GCM auth tag provides end-to-end tamper
 *    detection (see src/services/mfaCrypto.ts).
 *  - `last_used_counter` tracks the highest TOTP counter step successfully
 *    verified per user. Replay protection is enforced in-app with a
 *    conditional UPDATE (`... WHERE user_id = $1 AND (last_used_counter < $2
 *    OR last_used_counter IS NULL)`) which is safe under concurrency: only one
 *    of two simultaneous requests with the same step can win.
 *  - `verified` distinguishes a pending enrollment (secret issued, not yet
 *    confirmed) from an active one. Pending rows can be replaced with a fresh
 *    secret; verified rows require a deliberate re-enrolment flow.
 *  - fixed 6-digit / 30-second / SHA1 defaults match the RFC 6238 parameters
 *    used by mainstream authenticator apps.
