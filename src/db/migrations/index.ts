/**
 * Migration registry — the single source of truth for migration ordering.
 *
 * Add new migrations here in chronological order. The array order defines
 * the execution sequence for `up` and the reverse sequence for `down`.
 *
 * A duplicate-ID guard runs at module load time so misconfiguration is caught
 * immediately (at startup or test import) rather than silently at runtime.
 *
 * ID rules: every registered migration must expose a unique, zero-padded,
 * strictly sequential id ("001", "002", ...) in the SAME order as this array,
 * because `MigrationRunner` uses the id as the tracking-table key and
 * `driftDetector.validateMigrationOrder` asserts position N has id "(N+1)".
 * Renumber here (and in the migration file) rather than reusing an id.
